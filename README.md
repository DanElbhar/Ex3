EX_3 version 1.0 - README

This project implements the "Pacman" game. 
In this project you can build the players' position alone or you can enter and play a ready game. 
The fruit-eating algorithm by the Packmans, works in this way: 
He checks to see which Pacman will eat the fruit faster and so on with the rest of the fruit.
